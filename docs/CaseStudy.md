# AskWise: Case Study

## ðŸ“Œ What Is AskWise?

AskWise is a self-built SaaS knowledge base platform powered by AI. It allows internal teams to upload documentation and interact with it via a chat interface â€” with simulated analytics to show usage and growth like a real startup.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why I Built It

I wanted a project that could:

- Demonstrate senior-level engineering across the stack
- Show working AI integration in useful settings
- Represent business-thinking (dashboards, PMF, etc.)
- Be something that could _actually be sold or funded_

## ðŸ’¡ What It Demonstrates

| Area             | What It Shows                                      |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Full-Stack Dev   | React frontend, Go backend, Postgres DB            |
| AI Engineering   | LangChain retrieval QA with user feedback          |
| Data Engineering | Simulated ELT, dbt â†’ enterprise + fact dashboards  |
| Infra/DevOps     | Docker, GitHub Actions, GCP Cloud Run              |
| Product Thinking | Analytics with PMF metrics, churn, cohort tracking |

## ðŸ“Š Sample Features (Live or In-Progress)

- Upload docs, chat with AI assistant
- Rate answers for model tuning
- Simulated user growth + conversion tracking
- AI-generated investor reports (e.g., Q2 update)

---

## ðŸš€ Why This Project Is Relevant

It reflects real-world SaaS product design:

- Built from scratch with production in mind
- Containerized and CI/CDâ€™d to cloud
- Designed to simulate Series-A level usage & ops

Employers or clients get to see:

- My coding ability
- My systems thinking
- My product sense
