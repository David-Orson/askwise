## [0.1.7] - 2025-07-26

### Added

- Built full Go backend with Fiber, GORM, and Neon (Postgres)

- Wrote unit tests for DocumentService.UploadDocument() using mocked ports

### Changed

- Refined domain encapsulation: made projectID, userID, fileName private with getters

- Enforced strict layering between core logic and infrastructure via interfaces

---

## [0.1.9] - 2025-07-27

- Added SQLite-backed repository integration test for PostgresDocumentRepository
- Table-driven tests for `UploadHandler` and domain validation logic
- Created `DocumentHandler` using Fiber, wired to the application service and user context
- `FromDomain()` presenter added defensive nil handling and tests

### Changed

- Domain model now uses `DomainBase` instead of GORM-coupled base struct
- Extracted `GormBase` (with tags) and `DomainBase` (clean) for separation of concerns
- Renamed repository test to use in-memory SQLite instead of Postgres for speed
- Enforced stricter invariants on filenames (no slashes, max length, lowercase extensions)
- Improved handler robustness by parsing `userID` from request context properly
- Unified mocking and modularized test helpers across layers

---

## [0.2.0] - 2025-07-29

### Added

- Introduced `user` module using Hexagonal architecture:
  - `User` domain model with encapsulated fields (`googleID`, `name`, `email`, `imageURL`)
  - `UserRecord` GORM struct with mapping functions (`toDomain`, `toRecord`)
  - `PostgresUserRepository` with methods: `FindByID`, `FindByGoogleID`, `Save`
  - `UserService.Sync()` handles "create-or-fetch" by Google ID
  - `UserHandler.Sync()` Fiber handler accepting Google ID and user details
- Defined presentation DTO (`UserResponse`) with safe field mapping
- Added `extractBearerToken()` helper for parsing `Authorization` headers

### Changed

- Split base structs:
  - `DomainBase` (clean, untagged) for domain logic
